# organisation-system
This software will help me organise my time based around my calender (including any scheduled events), any tasks I need to do, for example university work,
any projects I am working on, this project being an example, so that I can work more efficiently. It is being written in javafx 17 and java 18.
This is a project that I have been thinking about doing since December of 2020 and am finally starting in September of 2022.
To run the current snapshot of the project, organized-1.3-SNAPSHOT.jar you will need a mysql database conforming to the URL, username nad password that is found in the file found here: https://github.com/hurstie16s/organisation-system/blob/main/organized/src/main/resources/appData/config.properties
The database structre can be found here: https://github.com/hurstie16s/organisation-system/blob/main/MySql%20Scripts/createTables.sql
