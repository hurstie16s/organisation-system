# organisation-system
This software will help me organise my time based around my calender (including any scheduled events), any tasks I need to do, for example university work,
any projects I am working on, this project being an example, so that I can work more efficiently. It is being written in javafx 17 and java 18.
This is a project that I have been thinking about doing since December of 2020 and am finally starting in September of 2022.
To run the current snapshot of the project, SNAPSHOT
